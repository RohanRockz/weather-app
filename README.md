This is the Weather App which has been created using React JS as the main platform and Tailwind CSS has been used extensively in this project along with some libraries or basically sistes from Google which are Unicons.com,and Auth0.com which has been used to provide icons and authentication for the login-logout functionality as one of the feastures of the app.
The app uses all the data from Open Waether API and fetches it to the project and displays the weather of the particular city/country accordingly according to the users input.
The Top Buttons in the app are the list of favourite cities which on clicking displays the current weather conditions just on one click and to implement this redux react is being used.
The app also displays the current date and time of the particular city/country in the format as needed which is being implemented using the luxon function and also it contains a pointer which on click displays the weather along with all the details of the user's current location and a star button to add the current city/country to the list of favourites.
The app is designed using Tailwind CSS with a bluish transition background and also when searched the alert box is poped which displays the procedure of the backend happening and that is being designed using "toastify.com"and also the Celsius and Fahereneit converter of the temperatures.
Overall the details which the app displays are:
Weather Condition
Temperature in Celsius/Fahereneit
Real Feels
Humidity
WindSpeed
Sunset Time/Sunrise Time/Highest Temp/Lowest Temp.
Hope the user enjoys using the app and gets the information of the city/country's weather conditions across the globe.
